#CS 4518 Final Project Proposal: Team Up
##Team  1005: Jacob, Madeline, and Kit


####Problem: Forming groups with other students is often a hit-or-miss.
Using deep learning, we can maximize group performance, while making the work experience more pleasurable.

We propose an Android application that facilitates effective group matching via deep learning. Specifically, we match group members pairing complementary traits based on existing studies and personality analysis; for example, the Workplace Performance Index (WPI), Myers-Briggs Type Indicator tests, and skills matrix. Members register using a unique code provided by a supervisor or professor, which allows them to either create a profile or use an existing profile, then take a series of skill and personality assessments. Afterwards, students rate their group members on how well they collaborated. 

We will use Google Firebase to store the results from tests and for group matching. Deep learning will be used to improve group matching through the rating system.
